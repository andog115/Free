<h1>Tourist Spots</h1>
<p align="Justify" style="border:3px; border-style:ridge; border-color:gray; padding: 1em;"><i><small>The Philippines is
 a destination that is easy to visit multiple times due to its more 
than 7,000 islands. The most difficult decision you make as a traveler, is figuring 
out which island to visit first. The Philippines is divided into the three main island groups 
of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, representing different regions in the country.

The scenery in each region of the Philippines ranges from mountainous and tropical 
to metropolitan. You can enjoy a day of walking the historical colonial streets of the capital city 
of Manila or catch a rare glimpse of tiny tarsier monkeys at a private sanctuary on the island of Bohol.
 The steep, plush mountains provide unforgettable hiking experiences, and since you are surrounded by the 
Pacific Ocean, the
 scuba diving opportunities and beaches are some of the best in the world</p>

<h1>1. Boracay</h1>
<p align="Justify" style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:gray; padding: 1em;">There is a reason that Boracay 
Island is considered the beach capital of the Philippines because
 there are more than 12 beaches. This tiny island in the west Visayas region is ideal for beach-goers 
who are after simple relaxation in the sun or water activities. White Beach, on the west side of the island,
 is one of the most popular beaches, with a lively reputation. Puka Shell Beach is on the tip of the island 
and is a favorite spot for shell collectors. Cagban Beach is a quiet spot with nearby caves that are rumored 
to still contain treasure chests. Diniwid Beach is a tiny beach at the north end of White Beach that has the
 best view of the island from a platform rock located there. This island is known for its many resorts, so finding a place
 to stay is easy. For a panoramic view of the island, take a day trip to Mount Luho, its highest point.</p>

<h1>2.Coron Island</h1>
<p align="Justify" style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:gray; padding: 1em;">Although I didn’t 
get to visit Coron Island while I was travelling in Palawan, it is
 definitely one of the best places to see in Palawan.

You have two choices to get to Coron Island. You can either fly direct from Puerto Princesa 
or you can take a ferry from El Nido. The ferry ride is no short journey, though, it takes around
 8 to 10 hours to reach Coron. So, you have to weigh up whether you want to lose a day travelling there 
by boat!

Coron is similar to El Nido, in that it offers incredible views and some great beaches. There
 are numerous diving spots here as well. Not travelling to Coron is something I regret during my 
time in the Philippines.

Don’t make the same mistake as me and be sure to check it out! Tara Lets Anywhere has a great solo
 travel guide to Coron, you should check out!</p>

<h1>3. Cebu</h1>
<p align="Justify" style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:gray; padding: 1em;">The island of Cebu, in 
the central Visayas region, is considered the port to some
 of the best diving and snorkeling in the Philippines. If you are an underwater enthusiast
, Cebu is one of your best options for excursions that get you up-close to whale sharks,
 coral reefs, and sea turtles. Some of the most spectacular scenery from the water near
 Cebu are the sea caves that attract photographers and outdoor enthusiasts looking for 
unique diving and snorkeling sites. The Sudlon National Park, located approximately an
 hour from Cebu City, is a breathtaking park to explore and hike. While Cebu's greatest 
draw is its water, Cebu City is a metropolitan area, with tourist attractions
 like museums and cathedrals that will interest history buffs.

<h1>4.Vigan</h1>
<p align="Justify" style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:gray; padding: 1em;">The historical city of Vigan
 in the northern Philippines is one of the most charming towns 
to visit in the Luzon region. Its culture is a fusion of Chinese and Spanish influences originating 
from settlers to the area. Take a ride in a horse-drawn kalesa through the streets and admire the colonial
 architecture, courtesy of the Spanish who colonized the area in the 18th century. Vigan is a city with many
 nuances to explore. The best view of the area is from the Bantay Bell Tower, which is also a noted landmark in 
the area. The Calle Crisologo historic district is a walkable district, where you will encounter many local craftsman
 and see historical architecture. A visit to the St. Paul Metropolitan Cathedral is breathtaking and a 
perfect spot to sit and people-watch as you take in the local culture.</p>

<h1>5. Guimaras</h1>
<p align="Justify" style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:gray; padding: 1em;">Guimaras is one of the smallest island provinces in the Philippines, next to the lovely 
Siquijor and the enchanting Camiguin. Just like the other two, this little island has a number
 of hidden gems waiting to be discovered. While it is known to most people as the land of the sweetest mangoes
 in the world, the beaches and its other wonders should not be overlooked.</p></i></small>
